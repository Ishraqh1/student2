This week I worked with Aditya on AWS deployment. AWS deployment on VS Code involves configuring your Visual Studio Code development environment to connect with Amazon Web Services (AWS) services, allowing you to deploy and manage your website or web application on AWS infrastructure. This integration matters for a website because it streamlines the deployment process, making it more efficient and scalable. AWS provides a wide range of services, such as EC2 instances, S3 for storage, and RDS for databases, which can enhance website performance, reliability, and security, and VS Code integration simplifies the development and deployment workflow.
