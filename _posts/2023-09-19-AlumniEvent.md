Alumni Takeaways and Reflections 

It was great being able to attend the panel event and learn as much information as I could from each of the alumni. 

There were a lot of areas I felt that the work related to what I wanted to do. It was interesting to hear that Mabel didn’t go through CS and is not studying cognitive science but still has elements of CS in her major and future career. I like this since I definitely think CS is an important skill to know, but I also want to major and study other subjects that I also find really interesting. It was also informative to hear Colin talk about how hard it is to transfer into CS from another major. I realize now that CS is the type of degree that you have to fully commit to if you want to study in college. 

I also know that getting internships during the summers in college are super important to set up a career in CS. It was interesting to hear Tristan talk about how working on projects on the side helped open opportunities for him at LG. Tristan really emphasized how important it was to do the work on the side was, from building your own websites or making a simple game. Building projects like this are a great way to show employers that you already have experience coding on your own, and these can really help set up career opportunities into the future. This is definitely something I want to work on when I’m in college during summer and during my free time and learning to structure code and build code on my own. I also liked how Tristan talked about turning a personal passion into something CS-related. For example, he mentioned how his friend who was really into video games was able to make a shooter game on CS. And then that helped him learn a passion he had for CS. This is definitely something I want to try with some of the passions I have, like maybe coding a basketball shooter game. 

I also really liked hearing from Anthony, especially when I was able to privately talk with him before the meeting where he mentioned the intersection between CS and Economics. He talked about how he’s studying a more mathematical focus on economics and how he plans on using that to break into Quantitative finance. This definitely sounded interesting to me since I’m planning on majoring to economics to many schools, so I would definitely be excited in an opportunity where I can combine a passion in economics with an interest in CS to work in Quantitative finance. Anthony also told me that trying to get those jobs are really tough so I’ll still have to think more about wanting to do that. 

It was also interesting to hear Anthony talk about how hard it is to get an internship, especially if you’re a first-year. I think that inspired me to have to apply to many different programs during my time in college in order to have an opportunity to get an internship in the first place. It was interesting to hear him talk about how he only got accepted in one after he applied to sixty different programs. 

Overall, I found the whole experience really interesting to learn from.
