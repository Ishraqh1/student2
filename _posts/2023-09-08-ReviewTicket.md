Week 1: I had to make sure that all the tools are downloaded and that I had VS code downloaded with a GitHub account made and linked to my VS code. I also built my student page. 

Week 2: I did the Linex Shell and and Bash. I also worked on coding with Python IO. 

Week 3: Installed JS Calculator and different tricks/hacks. 

Week 4: Worked on JS Output and preapred for Pairshowcase. Had to make sure that my weekly plan was showing and I started a new repo. Also, had to make sure that my make function would work. 

Week 6 Hacks: I started by working on the HTML Hacks. I had to create an interface in which I could click on links that would properly show the Amazon and Forbes website, two websites that I used a lot. I also created a larger interface that also showed bigger font. The next hack I worked on was the basics of js where I input values for a and b and than had my inspect element show me which one was greater than the other. Than I did the basics js data types where I created code that succesfuly showed me my name, my age, and how tall I was as well as my weight. The next hack was the basics js with html which was similar to the first html hack, just this time clicking button one would change where the links would go to. Finally, I did the 1_4 hack where I worked through and analyzed some mistakes of games.
