We started learninga bout Python/Flask in Jupyter which will matter for our passion project which we present at N @ the meseum. I've learned that a web server is a digital platform that serves as a foundation for hosting and delivering web content, much like a library where librarians help find books. GitHub Pages and Flask are two examples of web servers, with GitHub Pages serving as a platform for publishing Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks in a structured manner, while Flask is a versatile micro web framework written in Python that allows for more customization and can manage various types of content, including web applications and APIs. Flask empowers users to create and manage web content, offering flexibility for individual preferences and additional features like database integration.
