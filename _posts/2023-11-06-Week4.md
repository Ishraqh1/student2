We spent this week learning about lists and dictionary purpose. I learned that a 'list' data type has a method called '.append(expression)' which allows you to add items to the list. In this example, the expression being appended to the list is of the data type 'class dict,' which is essentially creating a list of dictionaries. This data structure resembles JSON and is commonly used in various contexts like Jekyll/GitHub pages YAML files and FastPages Front Matter, so it's important to understand its key-value pattern for effective data manipulation.
