    "I think our group could have spent more time practicing what we went over in the review. Since, I realized while we were presenting that we went over some information twice that we didn't need to in the group. I also think that Hack 3 could have been a bit more unique and different then hack 2. Me and Aditya could have worked together, since Sumedha had set up much of the lessson that taught hack 3, and we could have gone over a lesson that combines what we did. Maybe have them print a list of values, but have them skip and stop the function at certain values. And then create multiplication tables with everything. "
